    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a technical writer with 18 years of experience working for NASA and DoD contractors.
        I live in Houston, Texas with my wife Jennifer and my ten-year-old cat Joey, who enjoys sleeping
        and "editing" leather furniture. When I'm not doing technical writing, I enjoy playing piano,
        programming, creative writing, and playing board games with friends (especially Magic: the Gathering).
    </p>
    <p>
        Most semesters, I work as an adjunct English professor. I teach Composition I and II,
        as well as Technical Writing. I teach writing as a craft that anyone can master with pursuit and practice.
    </p>
