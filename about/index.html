    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        I am a technical writer with 18 years of experience working for NASA and DoD contractors.
        I live in Houston, Texas with my wife Jennifer and my ten-year-old cat Joey, who enjoys sleeping
        and "editing" leather furniture. When I'm not doing technical writing, I enjoy playing piano,
        programming, creative writing, and playing board games with friends (especially Magic: the Gathering).
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a Master's degree in Literature from the University of Houston - Clear Lake and a Bachelor of Arts
        in English from the University of Florida. In December 2023, I also completed my second Bachelor's degree,
        this time in Software Development from Champlain College. While it may seem like I'm a "trophy hunter"
        of degrees, the real reason I keep pursuing education is to create a unique "talent stack" so that I
        can achieve greatness in my career and personal life.
    </p>
    <p>
        As an occasional, part-time job, I work as an adjunct English professor at San Jacinto College. I teach
        Composition I and II, as well as Technical and Business Writing (ENGL 2311). I teach writing as a craft
        that anyone can master with pursuit and practice. I also emphasize it as a necessary skill regardless
        of the career my students choose. My favorite moments are when a student who originally hated writing
        finds at the end of the semester that their effort has led to new-found confidence.

        I play piano as a hobby and often record myself on YouTube, and the link to my channel can be found below.
