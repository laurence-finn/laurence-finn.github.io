          My most recent novel is Skystrike. It's a far-future, post-apocalyptic
          science fiction story set on the distant, icy planet of Rhea. It
          follows a young woman named Keto as she discovers her culture's lost
          past. If legendary rogues, mythical goddesses, and deadly plagues
          sound interesting to you, this is your book, available now in Kindle
          and Paperback.

        <p>
          My first novel is a modern-day comedy set in the Appalachian Mountains, and it's
          kind of accidentally a Christmas story. There's also deep-woods
          cultists, fertilizer crime rings, and mysterious Russian guests.

  <h2 id="about">About Me</h2>
  <ul class="no-bullets">
    <li>
      <p>
        I am a technical writer with 18 years of experience working for NASA and DoD contractors.
        I live in Houston, Texas with my wife Jennifer and my ten-year-old cat Joey, who enjoys sleeping
        and "editing" leather furniture. When I'm not doing technical writing, I enjoy playing piano,
        programming, creative writing, and playing board games with friends (especially Magic: the Gathering).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>
        Most semesters, I work as an adjunct English professor. I teach Composition I and II,
        as well as Technical Writing. My guiding principle is anyone can (and everyone should)
        master the craft of writing--all it takes is patience and practice, and the rewards
        are great. The most successful people I've met are excellent communicators, no matter
        their field.
