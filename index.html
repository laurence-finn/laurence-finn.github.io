        <p>
          My most recent novel is Skystrike. It's a far-future, post-apocalyptic
          science fiction story set on the distant, icy planet of Rhea. It
          follows a young woman named Keto as she discovers her culture's lost
          past. If legendary rogues, mythical goddesses, and deadly plagues
          sound interesting to you, this is your book, available now in Kindle
          and Paperback.

        <p>
          My first novel is still out there, as well, with a new Second Edition.
          It's a modern-day comedy set in the Appalachian Mountains, and it's
          kind of accidentally a Christmas story. There's also deep-woods
          cultists, fertilizer crime rings, and mysterious Russian guests.
